 * Russian Post Office Branches
 * For online retailers shipping orders via mail across Russia, it's crucial to provide customers with information on where and when they can pick up their parcels.
 * This is where the directory of postal offices comes into playâ€”it includes precise addresses, coordinates, and operating hours of each branch, as well as
 * notifications if a branch is temporarily closed.
 *
 * @note: "Dadata" facilitates the search for the exact post office by postal index or finds the nearest one by coordinates, enhancing customer
 *        convenience and streamlining the pickup process.
